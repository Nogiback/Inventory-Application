# Inventory-Application

[NodeJS - Inventory Application Project - The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-inventory-application)

This is one of the first NodeJS projects under the Fullstack Javascript Development curriculum for The Odin Project. The purpose of this project was to build an inventory management app for an imaginary store. The inventory app should have categories and items that a user can interact with. The application should make use of all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods for both items and categories.

## Built With

NodeJS, Javascript, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Pug, Bootstrap

## Lessons Learned

The project solidified my experience with Mongoose, MongoDB and Express. I learned how to properly set up a MVC (Model, View, Controller) project with full CRUD methods. I also learned more about Pug templates and Bootstrap styling.
